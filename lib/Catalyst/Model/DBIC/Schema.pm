=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema - DBIx::Class::Schema Model Class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::Model::Foo;
    use strict;
    use base 'Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema';

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        schema_class => 'Foo::SchemaClass',
        connect_info => [ 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foodb',
                          'postgres',
                          '',
                          { AutoCommit => 1 },
                        ],
    );

    # In controller code:

    # ->schema To access schema methods:
    $c->model('Foo')->schema->source(...);

    # certain ->schema methods (source, resultset, class) have shortcuts
    $c->model('Foo')->source(...);
    $c->model('Foo')->resultset(...);
    $c->model('Foo')->class(...);

    # For resultsets, there's an even quicker shortcut:
    $c->model('Foo::Bar')
    # is the same as $c->model('Foo')->resultset('Bar')

    # To get the composed schema for making new connections:
    my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->composed_schema->connect(...);

    # Or the same thing via a convenience shortcut:
    my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->connect(...);

    # or, if your schema works on different storage drivers:
    my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->composed_schema->clone();
    $newconn->storage_type('::LDAP');
    $newconn->connection(...);

    # and again, a convenience shortcut
    my $newconn = $c->model('Foo')->clone();
    $newconn->storage_type('::LDAP');
    $newconn->connection(...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NOTE: This is the first public release, there's probably a higher than
average chance of random bugs and shortcomings: you've been warned.

This is a Catalyst Model for L<DBIx::Class::Schema>-based Models.  See
the documentation for L<Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema> and
L<Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::SchemaLoader> for information
on generating these Models via Helper scripts.  The latter of the two
will also generated a L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader>-based Schema class
for you.

=head1 CONFIG PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item schema_class

This is the classname of your L<DBIx::Class::Schema> Schema.  It needs
to be findable in C<@INC>, but it does not need to be underneath
C<Catalyst::Model::>.  This parameter is required.

=item connect_info

This is an arrayref of connection parameters, which are specific to your
C<storage_type>.  For C<::DBI>, which is the only supported C<storage_type>
in L<DBIx::Class> at the time of this writing, the 4 parameters are your
dsn, username, password, and connect options hashref.

This is not required if C<schema_class> already has connection information
defined in itself (which would be the case for a Schema defined by
L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader>, for instance).

=item storage_type

Allows the use of a different C<storage_type> than what is set in your
C<schema_class> (which in turn defaults to C<::DBI> if not set in current
L<DBIx::Class>).  Completely optional, and probably unneccesary for most
people, until other storage backends become available for L<DBIx::Class>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

Instantiates the Model based on the above-documented ->config parameters.
The only required parameter is C<schema_class>.  C<connect_info> is
required in the case that C<schema_class> does not already have connection
information defined for it.

=item schema

Accessor which returns the connected schema being used by the this model.
There are already direct shortcuts on the model class itself for
schema->resultset, schema->source, and schema->class.

=item composed_schema

Accessor which returns the composed schema, which has no connection info,
which was used in constructing the C<schema> above.  Useful for creating
new connections based on the same schema/model.  There are direct shortcuts
from the model object for composed_schema->clone and composed_schema->connect

=item clone

Shortcut for ->composed_schema->clone

=item connect

Shortcut for ->composed_schema->connect

=item source

Shortcut for ->schema->source

=item class

Shortcut for ->schema->class

=item resultset

Shortcut for ->schema->resultset
